   dotnet run --project StarConflictsRevolt.Server.WebApi
   ```

2. **Run the Raylib Client**
   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   dotnet run --project StarConflictsRevolt.Clients.Raylib
   ```

## Configuration

The client configuration is in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "GameClientConfiguration": {
    "GameServerHubUrl": "http://localhost:5267/gamehub"
  }
}
```

## Architecture

### Key Components

- **GameState**: Central state management for session, player, and UI state
- **GameCommandService**: HTTP client for sending game commands
- **UIHelper**: Reusable UI components and styling
- **RenderContext**: Integration layer between UI and game data
- **SignalRService**: Real-time communication with game server

### View System

Each game view implements the `IView` interface:
- `ViewType`: Identifies the view type
- `Draw()`: Renders the view content

Views are registered in `Program.cs` and automatically selected based on the current `GameState.CurrentView`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No world data available"**
   - Ensure the game server is running
   - Check that you've joined a session

2. **Connection errors**
   - Verify the server URL in `appsettings.json`
   - Check that the server is accessible on the configured port

3. **Build errors**
   - Ensure .NET 9.0 SDK is installed
   - Run `dotnet restore` to restore packages
